# Customer Clustering for Marketing Strategy

## Project Overview
This project leverages clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their data, facilitating personalized marketing strategies. It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle's "Customer Personality Analysis" to identify distinct customer groups and their behaviors.

## Dataset
The project employs the "Customer Personality Analysis" dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). This dataset includes detailed customer transactions and behaviors, which were cleaned and preprocessed for accurate clustering analysis.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was prepared for analysis, ensuring data quality and relevancy.
- **Clustering Analysis:** We applied K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering models to uncover unique customer segments.
- **Evaluation and Profiling:** Each model's performance was evaluated, and the resulting clusters were profiled to derive targeted marketing strategies.

## Results
Identifying customer segments enabled the development of targeted marketing strategies, enhancing the personalization of customer engagement.

## Technologies Used
